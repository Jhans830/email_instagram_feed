# Instagram Feed for Salesforce Marketing Cloud Email Campaigns

This fetches a user's instagram data through the instagram API and then writes that data to a lookup data extension that can be used to populate a dynamic css file.

## To Use:
First, create both an HTML and CSS microsite. Then simply replace the access token and include the name of your data extension where you want the data passed inside the .html file.
